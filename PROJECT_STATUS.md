## Local Run Notes

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Initialize local SQLite database:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
.\server\node_modules\.bin\prisma.CMD db execute --schema server/prisma/schema.prisma --file server/prisma/manual-init.sql
node server/prisma/seed.js
```

If adding columns to an existing local database, apply the incremental SQL files in `server/prisma/`.

Build frontend:

```powershell
cd client
.\node_modules\.bin\vite.CMD build
```

Start local API and built frontend:

```powershell
node server/src/server.js
node scripts/serve-client.mjs
```

URLs:

- Client: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- API: `http://127.0.0.1:4000`

## Deployment Plan

Recommended:

- Frontend: Vercel
- Backend API: Render
- Database: Supabase Postgres

Before production:

- Convert Prisma datasource to PostgreSQL
- Replace manual SQLite SQL setup with real migrations
- Create production Admin user flow
- Remove reliance on demo users/passwords
- Add duplicate detection for imports
- Add import result details for skipped rows

## Important Local Notes

- The local database may contain smoke-test leads created during verification.
- Those test rows are local only and are not committed to GitHub.
- Build sometimes needs unsandboxed filesystem access on Windows because Vite/Prisma use generated binaries and symlinked packages.
